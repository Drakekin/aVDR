aVDR is a random.org based dice roller that stores the dice rolled and generates images based on the dice rolls that then can be embedded in a forum post for play-by-post games.

TO RUN:
Upload all files to a suitable directory.
Change the <<host>>, <<database>>, <<username>> and <<password>> strings to match your details
Add a table called 'rolls' with the following rows:
	uid - varchar(128)
	rid - varchar(512)
	result - varchar(512)
	request - varchar(32)
	target - int(255)
	overtarget - int(255)
	highest - int(255)
	lowest - int(255)
	highestdoubles - int(255)
And you should be fine.
